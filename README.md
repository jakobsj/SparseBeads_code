# SparseBeads_code
This GitHub repo provides MATLAB demo code accompanying the SparseBeads dataset available from Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.290117.

The code demonstrates how to load a sinogram dataset and compute a CGLS reconstruction, as well as how to load the provided 2D central-slice FDK reconstructions.

The code requires the latest version of the SophiaBeads Dataset Project Codes, which can be obtained from http://sophilyplum.github.io/sophiabeads-datasets/. 

To run the sparseBeads.m demo script, place it inside the SophiaBeads directory and follow setup instructions from the SophiaBeads Dataset Project Codes.
